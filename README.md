# MNIST_Noob
I wrote the code as a break from CSE100 PA, which was depressing
* I built a KNN classifier without using any loop and it is short yet powerful (zen of python) and tested on MNIST
* I built a DNN using TF2.0 and tested on MNIST
* Those code calms me down and motivates me to write my cse100 PA
